It would be better to group \"BLUE, HARVEST, NEW, SAILOR\" together as they are all nouns, and \"DITTO, LIKEWISE, SAME, SECOND\" can be grouped together as they are all words that indicate similarity or sequence.\\n\\nLastly, make sure to follow the format provided exactly, with each line containing four words and nothing else. This will make it easier for the grader to read and understand your answer.\\n\\nKeep practicing, and you will improve!', \"You should notice these details:\\n\\nFirst, let's look at the words that describe intensity or degree: DEEP, EXTREME, FIERCE, and INTENSE.

These words all suggest some form of collision or contact.\\n\\nThe third group consists of words that are associated with sound or static: FUZZ, NOISE, SNOW, and STATIC. These words all have to do with auditory sensations or the absence of movement.\\n\\nFinally, the last group includes words that are somewhat unusual or unexpected: BLOODY, HAIL, PROUD, and VIRGIN. These words don't have an obvious connection, but they do share a certain uniqueness or distinctiveness.\\n\\nBy grouping the words in this way, you can see how they are related to each other and how they fit into broader categories. This will help you to better understand the words and to use them more effectively in the game.\", \"You should notice these details:\\n\\nFirst, let's look at the words that are related to weather conditions: CLOUD, FOG, HAZE, MIST.

These words should also be grouped together.\\n\\nNow, let's look at the words that are related to objects or things: BALL, BUMPER, FLIPPER, PLUNGER. These words should be grouped together.\\n\\nFinally, let's look at the remaining words: FIN, ICE, IRE, NETHER.

While WINDOW and LAUNDRY can be related as objects found in a room, BOND and CUFF are not directly related to them. Instead, consider grouping WINDOW with another object that can be found in a room, like a BOOKMARK or a TAB.\\n\\nFor the second group, you have JOKE, HISTORY, BUTTON, and MARTINI.

Similarly, \"CHUMP CHANGE\" is a common phrase, but \"CLIMATE CHANGE\" and \"SEA CHANGE\" are not related to the word \"CHUMP.\" It\\'s important to make sure that all the words in a group can form a common phrase with the same word.\\n\\nInstead, try looking for words that are related to directions or positions: BOW, PORT, STARBOARD, STERN. These are all nautical terms that indicate different parts of a ship.\\n\\nThen, consider words that are related to time or measurement: ALL, ERA, GAIN, TIDE. These words all have to do with the passage of time or the measurement of quantities.\\n\\nFinally, look for words that are related to emotions or relationships: ACUTE, BERMUDA, LOVE, RIGHT.

You have \"FLOW, REED, RIVER, STREAM\" together, but \"RIVER\" and \"STREAM\" are not in the given words. Instead, you should have \"DRIB, FLOW, REED, TANG\" as a group.\\n\\nSo, to improve your answer, you should rearrange the words in the third group and replace \"RIVER\" and \"STREAM\" with \"DRIB\" and \"TANG\" in the fourth group.

Instead, look for a group of four words that are related and include \"BOYS\" and \"LIEUTENANT\".\\n\\nKeep trying, you\\'re on the right track!', 'You should notice these details:\\n\\nFirst, let\\'s focus on the words that are related to actions or verbs. You have correctly identified \"HOP, LEAP, JUMP, SPRING\" as a group, which is great.\\n\\nNext, let\\'s look at the words that are related to containers or places where things are kept. You have \"CHEST, COFFER, SAFE, VAULT\" in one group, which is also correct.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s examine the words that are related to time. You have \"AGE, DAY, ERA, TIME\" in one group, which is correct as well.\\n\\nHowever, there seems to be a mistake in your last group. The words \"FIRE, FLOW, REED, TANG\" don\\'t seem to be related to each other. Instead, try to find words that are related to a certain verb phrase or action, or words that can form a common phrase when paired with another word. You might want to reconsider the words \"FIRE\" and \"FLOW\" and see if they can fit into a different group.\\n\\nRemember, the goal is to group the words in a way that they are related by a certain theme or category. Keep trying, and I\\'m sure you\\'ll get it right!']\n",
