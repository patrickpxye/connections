By carefully considering the word-level details and using logical reasoning, we can arrive at the solutions provided in the answer key.", "1.

By doing this, we can split the 16 words into 4 groups of 4 words, each with a distinct theme or category.", "1. GET SMALLER: The first group of words includes CONTRACT, LESSEN, REDUCE, and SHRINK.

I started by looking for words that related to the concept of something becoming smaller or decreasing in size or amount, and I found CONTRACT, LESSEN, REDUCE, and SHRINK. I then looked for words that related to different classes or levels of service on an airplane, and I found BUSINESS, COACH, FIRST, and PREMIUM.

THROWN IN TARGET GAMES: AXE, DART, HORSESHOE, RING\n\nNow, let's look for words that are associated with a certain action or game. Here, we can see that \"AXE,\" \"DART,\" \"HORSESHOE,\" and \"RING\" are all objects that can be thrown in target games. This is a clear category, so we can group these words together.\n\n4. ___ WRAP: BODY, BUBBLE, GIFT, SHRINK\n\nFinally, let's look for words that can form a common phrase when paired with another word.
