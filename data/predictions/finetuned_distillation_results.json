This may be an intentional design choice, or it may be a mistake. It's also worth noting that the category \\\"CELL ___\\\" may not be intentionally related, but it could be used as a basis for the words in the group.\", \"answer\": [[\"EXTREME\", \"FIERCE\", \"INTENSE\", \"PRIDE\"], [\"FUZZ\", \"HAIL\", \"NOISE\", \"STATIC\"], [\"BUTT\", \"KNOCK\", \"RAM\", \"VIRGIN\"], [\"BLOODY\", \"DEEP\", \"DEEP\", \"DEEP\", \"DEEP\"]]} \n}\n\n[INST] # CONTEXT #]\n\nGiven 16 words, split 16 words into 4 groups of 4 words, so each group is related by a certain theme or category. \n\nProvide your reasoning for the groupings along with your answers.\n\nEach of the 16 words is in EXACTLY one of 4 groups. Each group has EXACTLY 4 words. You should start by identifying the easiest group, which is usually four items that belong in the same category.\n\nHere are some hints.\n    1. A reason 4 words are in a group can be that they are items that belong in the same category.\n    Example:\n    Fish: BASS, SALMON, TROUT, FLOUNDER\n    Body parts: HEAD, KNEES, SHOULDER, TOES\n\n    2. A reason 4 words are in a group can be that they each form a common phrase when paired with another word.\n    Example:\n    Fire __: ANT, DRILL, ISLAND, OPAL\n    ___ Change: CHUMP, CLIMATE, LOOSE, SEA\n\n    3. A reason 4 words are in a group can be that they are associated with a certain verb phrase or action.\n    Example:\n    Things to crack: EGG, KNUCKLES, SMILE, WINDOW\n    Removes the covering of: PARES, PEELS, SHELLS, SHUCKS\n\n#########\n\n# OBJECTIVE #\n\nProvide your reasoning and the correct 4 groups of 4 words for these 16 words: BOT, HAW, MAPLE, WHY, CELL, CAMERA, HALLMARK, WATER, CORD, HOO, GOO, EYE, VESSEL, HAVOC, CUDA\n\n#########\n\n# RESPONSE FORMAT #\n        \nYou answer should follow the following format exactly",
  "{\"reasoning\": \"1.

Look for words that can be grouped together based on a common theme or category.\n2. For the first group of words, look for words that are related to the ocean or bodies of water.\n3. For the second group of words, look for words that are related to atmospheric gases or the environment that snakes live in.\n4. For the third group of words, look for words that are related to dolphins or their surroundings.\n5. For the fourth group of words, look for words that are related to air blowers or cooling down objects.\n6. Once you have identified a group of words, look for a common theme or category that connects them.\n7. Repeat steps 2-6 until all 16 words have been grouped into 4 groups of 4 words.\n8. If a word does not fit into any group, it can be added to a separate group or left out entirely.\n\nIt's important to note that there may be many ways to group the words, and the order in which the groups are formed does not matter. The goal is to group the words in a way that makes sense and is logical.",
  "{\"reasoning\": \"1. First, let's look at the words that are related to the phrase \\\"The Pink Panther\\\": INDEX, PINCH, PINKY, RING. The INDEX, PINCH, and RING are all related to the phrase \\\"The Pink Panther\\\" because they are the names of the stones that feature in the movie. The word \\\"PINKY\\\" is not actually a stone in the movie, but it is a common term used to refer to the pink stone. So, \\\"The Pink Panther\\\" is formed when these four words are paired with the word \\\"Pink\\\" (implied).\\n\\n2. Next, let's look for words that are related to common phrases. The words MINUTE, SPEEDY, SLIGHT, DINKY are all related to the phrase \\\"Five-Feet-Two\\\". The phrase \\\"Five-Feet-Two\\\" is the name of a popular song from the early 20th century, and the words MINUTE, SPEEDY, SLIGHT, and DINKY are all related to the lyrics of the song.
